 plato_venetian_arsenal: "Venetian Arsenal"
 desc_plato_venetian_arsenal: "The Arsenal of Venice, begun about 1104 AD, was eventually a sprawling complex of shipyards, armories, and weapons shops. Built to serve the needs of the Venetian Navy upon which the Republic relied for both its independence and its lucrative sea trade routes, it was termed “the most important example of a large production complex with a centralized structure of the pre-industrial” civilization. Different areas of the Arsenal produced a prefabricated ship part, armaments, rope, sails and everything needed to put together a warship in a single day if necessity demanded. A state-owned forest in the Montello hills provided the timber and tar. The Porto Magna (“great gate”) to the Arsenal was added c. 1460, from a design by the artist Jacopo Bellini, the first Classical Revival structure built in Venice; two stone lions, captured in Greece, were added to the entrance in 1687 to awe visitors. The Arsenal also, when not launching warships to beat down Venice’s challengers in the Mediterranean, produced most of the Venetian merchant ships bringing wealth back to the city-state … to build more ships."
 plato_al_hamra: "Alhambra"
 desc_plato_al_hamra: "The Alhambra began as a small fortress, constructed in 889 AD by the Moors of Granada in Andalusia (Spain); then it was rebuilt and expanded by the emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar in the 11th Century and yet again expanded and converted into a royal palace by Sultan Yusuf I in 1333. The al-Hamra (literally, “the red one”), so named for its red clay fortress walls, was lavish – at least by European standards of the time – with all the comforts, including indoor plumbing. It integrated the natural beauty of the spot with structures and gardens designed and outfitted by the finest Muslim, Jewish, and even Christian craftsmen and artisans of the region. Among its most striking aspects, many of the interior walls and columns are inscribed in carved flowing Arabic script with poetry and verses from the Quran."
 plato_mont_michel: "Mont St. Michel"
 desc_plato_mont_michel: "Perched on a rocky islet between Normandy and Brittany in the midst of sandbanks washed over by ocean tides, Mont St. Michel is a Gothic-style Benedictine abbey dedicated to the archangel Micheal built between the 11th and 16th centuries. Besides St. Aubert's skull, the Mont also was repository for bits of St. Petroc and St. Olaf and other holy relics. The place did have a practical purpose; its high walls, turrets and position made it of strategic worth … and many a French king stationed a small garrison (all that was needed) there. At low tide, it was readily accessible to pilgrims eager to give up a coin or two to be blessed; at high tide, the incoming sea would strand or drown any attacking force."
 plato_notre_dame: "Notre Dame"
 desc_plato_notre_dame: "Notre Dame is a mighty cathedral standing on the 'Île de la Cité', an island in the Seine River in Paris. Built on the site of an older church, which was in turn built on the site of a Roman temple to Jupiter, Notre Dame is a magnificent example of gothic architecture and one of the greatest buildings standing. Construction of Notre Dame began in 1163 and took almost two centuries to complete."
 plato_iceland_volcano: "Eyjafjallajokull"
 desc_plato_iceland_volcano: "Eyjafjallajokull is the name for both an Icelandic volcano and the ice cap plugging its caldera.

Volcanic ash contains very high concentrations of minerals, and when mixed with soils, nutrients such as phosphates, nitrates, potassium and calcium (among others) which are needed for the healthy growth of plants. Volcanic soil is fertile because it is new, having just been erupted out into the upper world."

 desc_plato_baghdad_city: "After the fall of the Umayyads, the first Muslim dynasty, the victorious Abbasid rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule.

It was built under the supervision of the Barmakids. Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasids. Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying: "This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward"."

 plato_toldeo_steel: "Steel of Toledo"
 desc_plato_toldeo_steel: "The origin of Toledo steel comes from ancient Spanish customs. Toledo steel was used mostly in crafting weapons for armies during the 16th-19th centuries.  The name comes from the city where these special steel products were crafted; Toledo, Spain. During times of war in the 16th-19th centuries, armies would usually be heavily armored and/or be using shields. Thus, a hard and flexible weapon was needed to counter this, and the Toledo sword was that weapon."

Around that sprang a monastery, and then a town devoted to spreading Christianity throughout Ireland—a beachhead of theology."
 plato_citystate_alquarvan: "Center of Learning"
 desc_plato_citystate_alquarvan: "Founded by the Umayyad caliph Mu’awiya around 670 AD, Kairouan – located on the north coast of Africa – would become one of Sunni Islam’s most important centers of scholarship and education, its university attracting scholars from across the Arabic world. Thus, its fame spread even to Northern Europe – although tales of its wealth were greatly overblown. Following the mass conversion of the Berbers by the Prophet’s words, they captured Kairouan with its luxurious gardens and expansive olive groves in 745. Power struggles saw various rulers, some benevolent and some less so. In the reign of Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat, palaces, fortifications and waterworks were built, making the town ever more famous. Envoys from the courts of Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with fabulous tales of Kairouan’s great gardens and libraries. With the rise of the Fatimid dynasty c. 909, however, the town lost its importance and influence as the new rulers transferred their capital elsewhere more defensible."

The Serdi, a Thracian tribe, first settled the area c. 700 BC; around 29 BC the Serdi settlement was conquered by the Romans. The town, lying on an important trade route through the Balkans, flourished during the emperor Trajan's reign (98-117 AD), and reached its height of prosperity and peace during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Constantine. Thereafter, Sofia's history is primarily one of strife, war and conquest."
