The definition and extent of this equality may be different from place to place, but the idea that the nation is one of equals, each with common stake in its survival, is a powerful one.

 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC52: "Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching. However, Christians have struggled since the days of the Church fathers with the question of when the use of force is justified. Throughout history, biblical passages have been used to justify the use of force against heretics, sinners and external enemies.

 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC53: "In some ways, humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence. Humanist education was based on the programme of 'Studia Humanitatis', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric. The Renaissance also brought and emphasis upon going back to the original sources. Many of the Greek classics made their way to western Europe as the great Greek libraries of eastern Roman Empire were moved west to be kept safe from the advancing Muslim armies. Scholars began to want to read these classics in the original language. Now, Renaissance has come to our country too..."

 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC57: "Despite our efforts, more and more people in our country dislike our current government, favoring more traditional and less... equal society.

 plato_liberty_event.EVTOPTA57: "Interesting..."
 plato_liberty_event.EVTNAME58: "Rising Social inequality"
 plato_liberty_event.EVTDESC58: "In the past years, the social inequality has worsened quite a bit. The nobility gains power and wealth and our overall economy thrives, but many street spokesmen and foreigners agitate our peasants and lower class to take up arms and overthrow the opressive regime. While this is unacceptable, we must react to rising social tensions in this regard."

More so, instead of Sunni or Shia sultan, the Empire was founded by zealous Zoroastrians from Zanjan. It was through exceptional leadership, magnamity of soul and tolerant rule Kvaadirs managed to establish one of the largest Empires the Middle East has ever seen. Strong our country may seem, it faces severe religious problems - state religion of Zoroastrianism is still followed by minority in the country and muslim rebels and separatists either want to see the ruler become muslim or see Varant fall.

 wiki_event.EVTNAME11: "Lore"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC11: "Initially, Plato’s Europa began as a fix for my converted CK II game. I was Latgale (and later changed to play as Israel, Norway and Andalusia). My session was really interesting and I thought it would be fun to release it as a mod. Obviously, CK 2 converter is flawed and I had to do some changes to the map. I also wanted to change some national ideas, as new countries had atrocious ‘Basic Ideas’, so I used my games history and shaped the national ideas in a way, that would portray my gameplay. \n\nChange after change, this mod grew, and eventually become a Plato’s Europa you know now. New countries have their national ideas, (some are even blessed with missions) events and government types (Latgalia, Israel, Athens). The old ones were also affected, for example – Austria. Austria is no longer ruled by Habsburgs, but by Babenbergs. Hence, their national ideas are also changed. As of the outside ‘Europe’ world, I also used my imagination on Asia, Africa and even Americas. True, these regions were not changed as much as Europe (mostly due to my limited knowledge of history of these regions), but I did try to do my best to create a semi-realistic (yeah, I know how this sounds) and fun alternative scenario. I hope I succeeded."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME13: "Avoiding Anti-Blobbing penalties"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC13: "While §RAnti-Blobbing§! does restrict everyone’s expansion (including AI) it does not permit one to blob completely. You can still try to form Rome (you absolute madman), but now you have to work harder and smarter. Your main foe is unrest, and hence you must focus on avoiding it. Seek advisors, ideas, religions that will help you lower it. A better idea would be to use Vassals, Personal Unions and Client states instead, as Vassal territories do not count towards §RAnti-Blobbing§! (annexing them does, however). \n\nFinally, as the technology progresses, §RAnti-Blobbing§! slowly stops being an issue. While the first three centuries may seem like a cluster-fuck of states growing and exploding, the end game is more stable in this regard and states actually begin to turn into ‘blobs’ (while still being affected by §RAnti-Blobbing§!)."

For example, All countries that had reduced unrest national idea, have the bonuses reduced from -2 to -1. Lot of countries were nerfed, a lot more were buffed (not because of balance, but because of lore). Changes also include §Breligions, government reforms, policies, decisions, events, province terrain, age abilities and buildings§!. \n\nQuite important change is unique §Bprovince modifiers§!, such as Alhambra, Damascus steel, Mount St. Michel and various Holy Sites (Kent, Sjaelland, Baghdad, Mt.

Apart from that, changes also include different country colors and flags, as well as historical ideas. §BNew cultures§! were also added, most importantly, for Turkey (Turkish has become a culture group)."

Plato’s Europa is a global overhaul that changes so many aspects in the game, that it would be hard to find a mod that would be compatible with it. You may try some at your own risk, but bear in mind that any future issues that arise from them I won’t be able to fix for you. The only §G‘safe’§! mods to use are graphics and visuals ones, such as Unit and building Model changes or map ones, such as Terratum Orbis or Graphical Map Improvements (I used both of them with Plato’s Europa and everything worked like a charm). The mods that add more provinces are advised against as well. The alternative flags mods are also not recommended, as the mod changes them too. Instead of causing yourself headaches with other mods, better share your thoughts and ideas with me on what should be added in the future."

 wiki_event.EVTNAME16: "Interesting Countries"
 wiki_event.EVTDESC16: "Since in Plato’s Europa size is no longer the most important factor of strength (because of §RAnti-Blobbing§!), country strength now lies in their National Ideas, Development, Government, Events and Missions. There are several countries that have the potential to become a major powers (or they already are). Now you can tell which countries are strong by their size (Andalusia, Japan, Navarasids), I will list some countries that may not seem too powerful at first.\n\n§BLatgalia§! has powerful and special national ideas, government and religion, all of which contribute to their military might. Despite having weak economy, they have the power to punch way above their size and can quickly become a major power in the region. They are in best position to form United Baltic Provinces – a country with powerful national ideas and large mission tree.\n\n§BNorway§!, similarly to Denmark in base EU4, controls majority of Scandinavia and part of Britain. Holding the throne of England may be difficult, but if they manage to secure it and use their colonial bonuses, they can become a foe to be reckoned with.\n\n§BVarant§! does not have it easy at the start because of the low religious unity and incoming revolts and turmoil, but if they do manage to fix all their internal issues, they can secure their status of the strongest country in the game and give nightmares to everyone from Mediterranean to the Pacific. More so, if they remain Zoroastrian, they can eventually re-establish the mighty Achaemenid Empire.\n\nLastly, you may also give smaller nations a shot. While the large countries may grow and expand, they will eventually break down and ‘explode’, but the small nations will thrive (if they survive, of course). These include Iceland, Riga, Malta, Oeselians and Athens. If you like tall play, try them out."
